## Before you start — this skill works with or without Mosofin

**With Mosofin connected**, the skill reads your live accounting data through the
gateway: the figures come from your own books, it validates against the real chart of
accounts, and most steps run automatically.

**Without it, the skill still works.** No subscription, no connector, or a skill copied
on its own — you are not blocked and you are not asked to buy anything first. The
Mosofin gates are skipped and you are asked for what each step needs instead: a trial
balance, a statement, an export, the documents themselves. **The accounting logic, the
edge cases and the output standards are identical** — only where the numbers come from
changes, and the output always says which is which.

### Strict rule — this skill never changes your data

**This skill will never write, update or delete existing data in any data source.**
Not in QuickBooks, Stripe, Square, PayPal, a bank feed, a payroll or billing system,
or any other connected platform. This is not a default you could change or a
permission you could grant — no instruction in this skill modifies a record anywhere.

It will **never**:

- create, edit, overwrite, void or delete a record in a connected platform
- invoke a write operation, or ask you to approve or enable one — a write tool is out
  of scope even when your policy has it enabled
- direct you to update, overwrite or delete existing data in a data source
- copy or move data from one connected platform into another

What it does instead is **read, and propose.** Every entry, schedule, reconciliation
and document it produces is a **draft for you to review.** Where it finds a problem —
a duplicate, a mismatch, a stale balance — it describes the problem and proposes a
correcting entry as a draft. It does not tell you to delete or overwrite the original,
and it never acts on one itself.

Whether anything reaches your books is a decision you make outside this skill, in your
own system, by your own hand. **If you act on none of it, nothing in your data has
changed.**

### Onboarding — required whenever Mosofin is connected

**If the Mosofin gateway is connected, onboarding is not optional and not per-skill.**
Before any skill reads anything, the workspace and the data sources in it must be
confirmed with you. It is the same sequence for every Mosofin skill, so it is kept in
one place rather than repeated in each:

- in this repo: [`shared/onboarding.md`](../../shared/onboarding.md)
- installed on its own, or you would rather read the product docs:
  [docs.mosofin.com/start-here/quickstart](https://docs.mosofin.com/start-here/quickstart)

**Already onboarded this workspace?** Then you have answered it once and will not be
asked again from scratch — but **the confirmation itself still happens every run.**
Gate 0 reads your workspace back and waits for an explicit yes; Gate 1 settles which
company file. Those are not skippable, and no data is read before them.

**No Mosofin connector? The skill still works.** If the gateway is not present at all,
there is nothing to onboard: the gates are skipped, every step becomes `[manual]`, and
you are asked for what each step needs — a trial balance, a statement, an export.
**The accounting work is unchanged**; only the data source is. You will be told this
once, and you will not be asked to install anything before being helped.

What follows in **Part A** is not more onboarding. It is this skill exploring what your
confirmed workspace and data sources can actually do — which tools exist, which serve
this particular request — so the run is shaped around your books rather than a generic
template.
