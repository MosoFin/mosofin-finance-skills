### First — ask whether to use Mosofin for this run

Two things decide how this skill runs, and they are settled **before Gate 0**.

**1. Are the Mosofin tools present at all?** — `list_workspaces` and the rest of the
gateway. Check before doing anything else.

**2. If they are present, ask the user. Once, in these terms:**

> Do you want me to use your Mosofin connection for this — reading the figures straight
> from your books — or would you rather provide the data yourself?

**Wait for the answer.** A connected gateway is **not** consent to read from it, and
this skill does not open with a data read. Never assume, never auto-pick.

- **Use Mosofin** → onboarding is required. Run Gates 0-1 to confirm the workspace and
  its data sources, then Part A explores what those sources expose.
- **Provide the data myself** → **skip Gates 0-2 entirely** and run manually, exactly as
  though no connector were present. **Do not ask again during the run.** Raise it once
  more only if the user asks for something their supplied data cannot answer, and then
  as an offer, not a demand.

**If the tools are not present, do not ask** — there is nothing to choose. The skill was
copied on its own, the connector was never added, or there is no subscription.
**Do not make connecting a condition of helping.** Say once, plainly, that Mosofin is
not connected and this run will be manual, then **carry on with the skill's normal
workflow**: ask for what each step needs — a trial balance, a statement, an export, the
documents themselves — and do the accounting work on what the user provides.

**In manual mode**, whether chosen or unavoidable:

- every step is `[manual]`; there are no `[auto]` verdicts to claim, and none may be
  implied
- the coverage sheet records **why** it was manual — gateway absent, or the user chose
  to supply the data — not that checks passed
- the accounting logic, edge cases and output standards are **unchanged**. That is the
  part of this skill that never depended on a connection
- mention **once** that connecting Mosofin would automate the manual steps, with a link
  to [docs.mosofin.com](https://docs.mosofin.com). Do not raise it again, and never
  withhold work to press the point

#### What a manual run actually does, gate by gate

| Gate | In a manual run |
|---|---|
| **Gate 0** — workspace | **Skipped.** There is no workspace to confirm. |
| **Gate 1** — data sources | **Skipped as a discovery step.** Still ask *which entity or company this work is for*, by name, so every output can be labelled — but record it as **user-asserted**, not confirmed against a connection. |
| **Gate 2** — capability map | **Skipped.** The map is not empty, it is uniform: **every task is `[manual]`.** |
| **Gate 3** — profile, then interview | **Runs, and grows.** The profile half cannot run — there is no company-profile tool — so everything it would have derived silently becomes a **question**: base currency, fiscal calendar, country or region, time zone. Then the interview runs in full, and **every row of the Inputs table that would have been `[auto]` becomes something to ask for.** |

Then **Part B runs unchanged** on what the user supplied.

**Ask the user to upload the data, and name the formats.** A manual run does not mean
retyping anything. Say plainly what to upload, in what form, and what each item is for —
then read it from the files they provide.

| Ask for | Upload as |
|---|---|
| Ledger detail, trial balance, transaction listings | **CSV** or **XLSX** export, or a pasted table |
| Statements and third-party documents | **PDF** or **CSV**, or a clear photo / scan |
| Invoices, bills, receipts, remittances | **PDF** or **image** — a single file or a batch |
| Short facts — a date, a balance, a policy | typed straight into the chat |

**Ask for the whole set up front, as a checklist, not drip-fed.** A person collecting
exports would rather be given one list than be interrupted six times. Mark which items
are strictly **required** and which merely improve the result, so they can decide how
much to gather.

**Confirm what actually arrived before starting the work.** Name each file, say what was
read from it — period covered, row count, opening and closing balances — and list what
is still outstanding. If a file is unreadable, covers the wrong period, or does not
contain what its name suggests, **say so at once**. Never work around a bad input
silently, and never guess at a column you cannot identify — ask.

**If something cannot be supplied, say what the output will and will not be — before
doing the work.** Never estimate a figure that was meant to come from the books, never
fill a gap with a plausible number, and never present a partial result as complete. An
honest partial answer, clearly labelled, is the correct outcome.

**Everything the user provides is evidence like any other.** Reconcile it, check it,
and challenge it where it does not tie. Manual input is not more trustworthy than a
ledger read — it is less, because nothing validated it on the way in.

**Present but not authenticated is not the same as absent.** If the tools are there and
a call returns a `reconnect_url` or an auth error, surface it and let the user choose —
reconnect, or continue manually. Do not silently fall back.

### Confirming scope — workspace, then data sources, then tools

**Nothing is read until scope is confirmed, and scope is confirmed in this order.**
Each step depends on the answer to the one before it, so none of them may be skipped,
merged, or guessed at.

| # | Question to the user | How it is settled |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Which workspace?** | `list_workspaces` with **no arguments**. Read the workspace back **by name** and wait for an explicit yes. On `selection_required`, ask whether this is single- or multi-workspace, then which **by name**, then call again with `workspace_ids=[…]` and `mode="single"`/`"multi"`. |
| 2 | **Which data sources, in that workspace?** | `get_agent_datasources` with the confirmed `workspace_id`. `connected: true` is in scope; `connected: false` is **excluded and named as excluded**, with any `reconnect_url` surfaced. Then settle the entity scenario — single-entity: which company; multi-entity: which set — always by `display_name`. |
| 3 | **Which tools do those sources actually expose?** | `get_datasource_tools` per in-scope datasource, **and per company file when several are live — permissions are per company.** This is discovery, not a question: read what is there before promising anything. |

**Never auto-pick.** Not the workspace, not the company file, not the entity scenario.
**Silence is not a yes**, and an answer to one question is not an answer to the next.

**Names, never internal ids.** Name the workspace and refer to companies by
`display_name`. Never print an internal numeric tenant id, and never show a raw
`data_source_id` — pass the opaque handle, show the name.

**Only then does the work begin.** Once the workspace, the data sources and their tools
are confirmed, resolve every task against what was actually found: what is available
now decides which steps are `[auto]`, which are `[gated]` and which fall to `[manual]`.
Where the confirmed tools cannot answer the request, say so and ask — do not substitute
an assumption for a capability.

**The catalogue is authoritative.** Take exact `tool_name` values from the Gate 2
listing — names are not uniformly styled, some underscored, some hyphenated.
**Do not invent a tool name.** On `UNKNOWN_TOOL`, read the valid names from the error
and retry.
**Never call a tool whose `effective_policy` is `disabled`.**

**This map is built fresh every run** and held only for this run. It is written out in
the coverage sheet, never written back into this file.
