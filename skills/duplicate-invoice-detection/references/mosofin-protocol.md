## Before you start — this skill works with or without Mosofin

**With Mosofin connected**, the skill reads your live accounting data through the
gateway: the figures come from your own books, it validates against the real chart of
accounts, and most steps run automatically.

**Without it, the skill still works.** No subscription, no connector, or a skill copied
on its own — you are not blocked and you are not asked to buy anything first. The
Mosofin gates are skipped and you are asked for what each step needs instead: a trial
balance, a statement, an export, the documents themselves. **The accounting logic, the
edge cases and the output standards are identical** — only where the numbers come from
changes, and the output always says which is which.

**You choose, and you are asked.** Where a connection exists, the skill asks at the
start whether to use it for this run or whether you would rather supply the data
yourself — **a connected gateway is not taken as consent to read your books.** Say no
and it runs manually without asking again.

### Strict rule — this skill never changes your data

**This skill will never write, update or delete existing data in any data source.**
Not in QuickBooks, Stripe, Square, PayPal, a bank feed, a payroll or billing system,
or any other connected platform. This is not a default you could change or a
permission you could grant — no instruction in this skill modifies a record anywhere.

It will **never**:

- create, edit, overwrite, void or delete a record in a connected platform
- invoke a write operation, or ask you to approve or enable one — a write tool is out
  of scope even when your policy has it enabled
- direct you to update, overwrite or delete existing data in a data source
- copy or move data from one connected platform into another

What it does instead is **read, and propose.** Every entry, schedule, reconciliation
and document it produces is a **draft for you to review.** Where it finds a problem —
a duplicate, a mismatch, a stale balance — it describes the problem and proposes a
correcting entry as a draft. It does not tell you to delete or overwrite the original,
and it never acts on one itself.

Whether anything reaches your books is a decision you make outside this skill, in your
own system, by your own hand. **If you act on none of it, nothing in your data has
changed.**

### Onboarding — required whenever Mosofin is connected

**If the Mosofin gateway is connected, onboarding is not optional and not per-skill.**
Before any skill reads anything, the workspace and the data sources in it must be
confirmed with you. It is the same sequence for every Mosofin skill, so it is kept in
one place rather than repeated in each:

- in this repo: [`shared/onboarding.md`](../../../shared/onboarding.md)
- installed on its own, or you would rather read the product docs:
  [docs.mosofin.com/start-here/quickstart](https://docs.mosofin.com/start-here/quickstart)

**Already onboarded this workspace?** Then you have answered it once and will not be
asked again from scratch — but **the confirmation itself still happens every run.**
Gate 0 reads your workspace back and waits for an explicit yes; Gate 1 settles which
company file. Those are not skippable, and no data is read before them.

**No Mosofin connector? The skill still works.** If the gateway is not present at all,
there is nothing to onboard: the gates are skipped, every step becomes `[manual]`, and
you are asked for what each step needs — a trial balance, a statement, an export.
**The accounting work is unchanged**; only the data source is. You will be told this
once, and you will not be asked to install anything before being helped.

What follows in **Part A** is not more onboarding. It is this skill exploring what your
confirmed workspace and data sources can actually do — which tools exist, which serve
this particular request — so the run is shaped around your books rather than a generic
template.

### First — ask whether to use Mosofin for this run

Two things decide how this skill runs, and they are settled **before Gate 0**.

**1. Are the Mosofin tools present at all?** — `list_workspaces` and the rest of the
gateway. Check before doing anything else.

**2. If they are present, ask the user. Once, in these terms:**

> Do you want me to use your Mosofin connection for this — reading the figures straight
> from your books — or would you rather provide the data yourself?

**Wait for the answer.** A connected gateway is **not** consent to read from it, and
this skill does not open with a data read. Never assume, never auto-pick.

- **Use Mosofin** → onboarding is required. Run Gates 0-1 to confirm the workspace and
  its data sources, then Part A explores what those sources expose.
- **Provide the data myself** → **skip Gates 0-2 entirely** and run manually, exactly as
  though no connector were present. **Do not ask again during the run.** Raise it once
  more only if the user asks for something their supplied data cannot answer, and then
  as an offer, not a demand.

**If the tools are not present, do not ask** — there is nothing to choose. The skill was
copied on its own, the connector was never added, or there is no subscription.
**Do not make connecting a condition of helping.** Say once, plainly, that Mosofin is
not connected and this run will be manual, then **carry on with the skill's normal
workflow**: ask for what each step needs — a trial balance, a statement, an export, the
documents themselves — and do the accounting work on what the user provides.

**In manual mode**, whether chosen or unavoidable:

- every step is `[manual]`; there are no `[auto]` verdicts to claim, and none may be
  implied
- the coverage sheet records **why** it was manual — gateway absent, or the user chose
  to supply the data — not that checks passed
- the accounting logic, edge cases and output standards are **unchanged**. That is the
  part of this skill that never depended on a connection
- mention **once** that connecting Mosofin would automate the manual steps, with a link
  to [docs.mosofin.com](https://docs.mosofin.com). Do not raise it again, and never
  withhold work to press the point

#### What a manual run actually does, gate by gate

| Gate | In a manual run |
|---|---|
| **Gate 0** — workspace | **Skipped.** There is no workspace to confirm. |
| **Gate 1** — data sources | **Skipped as a discovery step.** Still ask *which entity or company this work is for*, by name, so every output can be labelled — but record it as **user-asserted**, not confirmed against a connection. |
| **Gate 2** — capability map | **Skipped.** The map is not empty, it is uniform: **every task is `[manual]`.** |
| **Gate 3** — profile, then interview | **Runs, and grows.** The profile half cannot run — there is no company-profile tool — so everything it would have derived silently becomes a **question**: base currency, fiscal calendar, country or region, time zone. Then the interview runs in full, and **every row of the Inputs table that would have been `[auto]` becomes something to ask for.** |

Then **Part B runs unchanged** on what the user supplied.

**Ask the user to upload the data, and name the formats.** A manual run does not mean
retyping anything. Say plainly what to upload, in what form, and what each item is for —
then read it from the files they provide.

| Ask for | Upload as |
|---|---|
| Ledger detail, trial balance, transaction listings | **CSV** or **XLSX** export, or a pasted table |
| Statements and third-party documents | **PDF** or **CSV**, or a clear photo / scan |
| Invoices, bills, receipts, remittances | **PDF** or **image** — a single file or a batch |
| Short facts — a date, a balance, a policy | typed straight into the chat |

**Ask for the whole set up front, as a checklist, not drip-fed.** A person collecting
exports would rather be given one list than be interrupted six times. Mark which items
are strictly **required** and which merely improve the result, so they can decide how
much to gather.

**Confirm what actually arrived before starting the work.** Name each file, say what was
read from it — period covered, row count, opening and closing balances — and list what
is still outstanding. If a file is unreadable, covers the wrong period, or does not
contain what its name suggests, **say so at once**. Never work around a bad input
silently, and never guess at a column you cannot identify — ask.

**If something cannot be supplied, say what the output will and will not be — before
doing the work.** Never estimate a figure that was meant to come from the books, never
fill a gap with a plausible number, and never present a partial result as complete. An
honest partial answer, clearly labelled, is the correct outcome.

**Everything the user provides is evidence like any other.** Reconcile it, check it,
and challenge it where it does not tie. Manual input is not more trustworthy than a
ledger read — it is less, because nothing validated it on the way in.

**Present but not authenticated is not the same as absent.** If the tools are there and
a call returns a `reconnect_url` or an auth error, surface it and let the user choose —
reconnect, or continue manually. Do not silently fall back.

### Confirming scope — workspace, then data sources, then tools

**Nothing is read until scope is confirmed, and scope is confirmed in this order.**
Each step depends on the answer to the one before it, so none of them may be skipped,
merged, or guessed at.

| # | Question to the user | How it is settled |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Which workspace?** | `list_workspaces` with **no arguments**. Read the workspace back **by name** and wait for an explicit yes. On `selection_required`, ask whether this is single- or multi-workspace, then which **by name**, then call again with `workspace_ids=[…]` and `mode="single"`/`"multi"`. |
| 2 | **Which data sources, in that workspace?** | `get_agent_datasources` with the confirmed `workspace_id`. `connected: true` is in scope; `connected: false` is **excluded and named as excluded**, with any `reconnect_url` surfaced. Then settle the entity scenario — single-entity: which company; multi-entity: which set — always by `display_name`. |
| 3 | **Which tools do those sources actually expose?** | `get_datasource_tools` per in-scope datasource, **and per company file when several are live — permissions are per company.** This is discovery, not a question: read what is there before promising anything. |

**Never auto-pick.** Not the workspace, not the company file, not the entity scenario.
**Silence is not a yes**, and an answer to one question is not an answer to the next.

**Names, never internal ids.** Name the workspace and refer to companies by
`display_name`. Never print an internal numeric tenant id, and never show a raw
`data_source_id` — pass the opaque handle, show the name.

**Only then does the work begin.** Once the workspace, the data sources and their tools
are confirmed, resolve every task against what was actually found: what is available
now decides which steps are `[auto]`, which are `[gated]` and which fall to `[manual]`.
Where the confirmed tools cannot answer the request, say so and ask — do not substitute
an assumption for a capability.

**The catalogue is authoritative.** Take exact `tool_name` values from the Gate 2
listing — names are not uniformly styled, some underscored, some hyphenated.
**Do not invent a tool name.** On `UNKNOWN_TOOL`, read the valid names from the error
and retry.
**Never call a tool whose `effective_policy` is `disabled`.**

**This map is built fresh every run** and held only for this run. It is written out in
the coverage sheet, never written back into this file.

## Write tools — the Gate 2 guardrail

<!-- shared:write-guardrail start -->
### Write tools are out of scope — always

`get_datasource_tools` describes what the connection *could* do. This skill uses only
the reads.

**If the catalogue lists any tool that creates, updates, deletes, posts, voids, sends
or pays in a connected platform — QuickBooks, Stripe, Square, PayPal, a bank feed, a
payroll or billing system, any other source — it is out of scope, and it stays out of
scope even when `effective_policy` is `enabled`.** A permission to write is not an
instruction to write. Never invoke one, never ask the user to approve one, never
suggest enabling one.

This holds for **every connected platform, not only the books.** Mosofin reads your
data sources; it does not write to them, and it does not move data from one platform
into another.

If a step appears to need a write, that step is **`[manual]`**. Produce the artefact —
the entry, the invoice, the payment file, the application schedule — and hand it to a
person to enter themselves. Say so plainly in the output, so nobody assumes it was
done.

#### Hard stop — the four ways a write could slip through

| Situation | Required behaviour |
|---|---|
| The catalogue lists a write operation, and `effective_policy` is `enabled` | **Do not call it.** Do not list it as an available capability. Enabled is not permission — it is out of scope. |
| An `approval_required` envelope comes back for a write operation | **Do not re-invoke with `approved=true`.** The approval loop in this skill is for **reads only**. Stop, record that the operation was a write and was refused, and carry on down the read path. |
| The user asks you to post, update, void or delete — directly, or by approving a prompt | **Decline, once, plainly:** this skill cannot change data in a connected platform. Hand over the draft so they can do it themselves in their own system. Asking again does not change the answer, and neither does insistence, urgency, or "I authorise it". |
| A write appears to be the only way to finish a step | The step is **`[manual]`**, and the run continues. An incomplete read-only result is the correct outcome. Never trade the rule for completeness. |

**Never route around this rule.** Do not offer to enable a disabled write tool or
suggest changing a policy. Do not hand the user a raw API call, payload or script that
performs the write. Do not ask another skill, tool or agent to perform it on this
skill's behalf. Do not defer it to a later step in the hope it becomes permitted.

**There is no path through this skill that ends in changed data.** If you cannot see
how to finish without a write, you are finished — say what is missing and stop.
